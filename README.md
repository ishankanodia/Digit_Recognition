## Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Networks

### Overview
This project aims to build a neural network model to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging deep learning techniques to classify digits ranging from 0 to 9.

### Dataset
The dataset used is `digit_train.csv`, which contains 42,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, each represented as a 28x28 pixel image. Each pixel's intensity is represented by a number from 0 to 255.

### Model Architecture
The neural network is designed with three layers:
- **Input Layer**: 784 neurons (corresponding to each pixel in the image).
- **Hidden Layers**: 
  - **Layer 1**: 25 neurons, activated by ReLU.
  - **Layer 2**: 15 neurons, activated by ReLU.
- **Output Layer**: 10 neurons (one for each digit), activated by linear activation function.

### Training
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function. Training is conducted over 40 epochs using 99% of the data for training and 1% for validation.

### Evaluation
After training, the model achieved an accuracy of approximately 95.71% on the test set, indicating its ability to effectively classify handwritten digits.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the successful application of deep learning techniques to handwritten digit recognition, achieving high accuracy levels suitable for practical applications.
